 ###🎯 Student Marks Predictor – Day 1 of 7 Days of AI

Predict student marks based on study hours using **Linear Regression**. This is part of the **“7 Days of AI: Build Real Projects with Me!”** sprint.



## 📌 Project Overview

This beginner-level project demonstrates the fundamentals of **Supervised Machine Learning** using a **Linear Regression** model. The goal is to predict the number of marks a student might score based on the number of hours they studied.



## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

* Basics of regression in Machine Learning
* How to build a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn
* Data visualization with Matplotlib
* Model evaluation using R² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)



## 🗃️ Dataset

A simple CSV dataset with two columns:

* `Hours`: Number of hours studied
* `Scores`: Marks scored

Example:

```csv
Hours,Scores
2.5,21
5.1,47
3.2,27
8.5,75
...
```
